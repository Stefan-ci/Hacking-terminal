# Hacking-terminal

## About
Hi! This is my very first python project and it aims to simplify hacking just typing simple commands. I remarked using Metasploit is a bit difficult and you need to learn payloads and whta they do. So the goal of thta project to put in one script all necessaries and dependencies to hack into a server or website.
