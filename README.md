# Hacking-terminal

## About
Hi! This is my very first python project and it aims to simplify hacking just typing simple commands. I remarked using Metasploit is a bit difficult and you need to learn payloads and what they do. So the goal of that project is to simplify hacking writing in a single program most hacking tools. So all necessaries and dependencies to hack into a server or website will be in one script.

## Note:
I continue to work on that project so it is not the final result. I start with **Nmap scann** and I continue to edit and update it.
Any colab is welcome and can be done just creating pull requests.
